def sum(a, b):
    return (a + b)

print("A888168 WORKS HARD")  //write your student ID here
a = int(input('Enter 1st number: '))
b = int(input('Enter 2nd number: '))

print(f'Sum of {a} and {b} is {sum(a, b)}')
```

# EX3: INPUT AND OUTPUT

Question: 
```python
print("A888168 WORKS HARD")
a = input('Enter 1st number: ')
b = a + 2
```
Answers: two way

```python
print("A888168 WORKS HARD")
a = int(input('Enter 1st number: '))
# type(a)
b = a + 2
b
```

```python
print("A888168 WORKS HARD")
a = eval(input('Enter 1st number: '))
# type(a)
b = a + 2
b
```
